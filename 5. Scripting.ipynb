    "# Scripting Exercise: Creating an automatic report\n",
    "In the course up to now, we've learned about how we can use native python techniques (functions, if/else statements, conditionals, etc) to read interact with python data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we practice using these tools and see how they can be used to improve processes by automating tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scripting in python\n",
    "Remember that we can run python in two ways: in *scripting mode*, or in *interactive mode*.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run code in a notebook cell, we are running code in interactive mode. This is great when we want an immediate output, and when we want to see how our code works and check that it is working properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we want to create a program that we can use to repeatedly complete repetetive tasks, it's best to use python in script mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we package our code up into a .py file, and run it from the command line. When we do so, our entire file will run, not just individual lines. This is very powerful as it makes executing code for repetitive tasks very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving code into a script\n",
    "When developing a script for the first time, it can be helpful to first write and check your code in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by moving more and more of your code into one cell. Check where your code is running in the notebook with the command `!pwd`. Think about if this is also where you would want your script to run from.\n"

    "Our task is to **create a script that takes any string, and counts the number of characters in it.** It should just return the number of characters in the string.\n",

We can check this even within the jupyter system by simply putting `!` in front of the command. This exclamation point tells jupyter to execute the command as a bash command on the underlying server/computer system. It will be helpful for us if we start writing our script in the same place where we will run it, as where we run our script will influence while higher-level directories we have to include in our imports. \n",

However, if we run the code in a higher or lower level of the directory, we will need to specify the correct path to the file.
